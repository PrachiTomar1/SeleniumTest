- Latest Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver matching the Chrome version

Script Explanation:
1. Improved Readability:
    The script uses concise comments to make it clear and professional for GitHub documentation.
2. Error Handling:
    Enhanced handling with pytest.fail for better reporting in test logs.
3. Execution Simplification:
    Added verbosity (-v) and short traceback (--tb=short) options for cleaner output when running tests.
4. Natural Code Flow:
    Streamlined the logic for clarity, focusing on ease of understanding for contributors.
